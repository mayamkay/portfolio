<h1>Portfolio </h1> 

Take a look at some of my projects! Unfortunately, much of my code is private; however, this collection should give you a sense of some of my skills and interests.

_The scripts here were used in some of the projects displayed in <a href="https://mayamkay.github.io/">my portfolio</a>._

<h2> Projects: </h2>

<h3> Chicago Food Deserts </h3>
<em>Skills: ArcGIS, Python: BeautifulSoup, Pandas, GeoPandas </em> 
<br>
For this project, I pulled data on the number of grocery stores in various neighborhoods in Chicago. I then used this to generate a density map of Chicago using ArcGIS online and compared my map to a map that depicts the median household income by neighborhood in Chicago. The results, which can be seen on my <a href="https://mayamkay.github.io/projects/4_project/"> portfolio </a>, clearly demonstrate a correlation between the wealth of a neighborhood and the number of grocery stores. In less affluent neighborhoods, residents have to travel much further to find groceries, a phenomenon that is often referred to as "food desserts."

<h3> Restaurant Reviews </h3>
<em>Skills: ArcGIS, Python: BeautifulSoup, Pandas </em> 
<br>
For this project, I used BeautifulSoup to scrape yelp data and look at the average restaurant reviews for restaurants in cities across the US and abroad. I took the average reviews across the top 100 most reviewed restaurants in each city and used this to generate a map in ArcGIS online. The results can be found in my <a href="https://mayamkay.github.io/projects/3_project/"> portfolio </a>.

<h3> Ancona Air Pollution </h3>
<em>Skills: Python: matplotlib, numpy, Pandas </em> 
<br>
I looked at the Air Quality Monitoring in European Cities data set from Kaggle. The data set presents time domain measurements of various properties related to air quality in three different European cities. The notebooks associated with this project look at the air quality over time in Ancona, Italy. In particular, I looked at the parameter that describes the atmospheric aerosol concentration with a maximum particle diameter of 10 micrometers, as these small particles can cause health risks when inhaled. Measuring the concentration of the particles is often used as a proxy to talk about how safe the air is.
